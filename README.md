# 🌍 InclusionLens — Accessible & Inclusive Web Interface Tools

InclusionLens is a lightweight accessibility and inclusion support interface built to help improve the usability of web experiences for diverse users. The project focuses on practical accessibility features that support readability, visual comfort, keyboard navigation, and clarity of interaction.

The goal is to demonstrate how accessibility principles (WCAG 2.2 AA) and inclusive design decisions can be integrated into everyday interfaces in a clear, simple, and maintainable way.
